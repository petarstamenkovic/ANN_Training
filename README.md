Begginer artificial network training in MATLAB - Training Bool function on a MUX basis

I used MATLAB ANN toolbox (pattern recognition) to train couple of networks. Specifically I trained a MUX2-1 and MUX4-1 and exported them to a simulink and connected them into a given Bool Function.
For reducing I used a JADE java application to get my ROBDD diagram and accordingly i connected the mentioned components.
